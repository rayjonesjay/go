       The following backslash escape sequences are recognized:

       \\     backslash

       \a     alert (BEL)

       \b     backspace

       \xHH   byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)

       Note:
          Where it makes sense, the \0NNN octal escape takes precedence over the \0 null character.
          Any octal or hexadecimal values of ASCII characters that cannot be printed will be ignored.

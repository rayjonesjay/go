Description:
       The following backslash escape sequences are recognized:

       \\     backslash

       \a     alert (BEL)

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     carriage return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       \0NNN  byte with octal value NNN (3 digits)

       \0    null character

       \xHH   byte with hexadecimal value HH (2 digits)

       Note:
          Where it makes sense, the \0NNN octal escape takes precedence over the \0 null character.
          Any octal or hexadecimal values of ASCII characters that cannot be printed will be ignored.

       go run main.go "Hello"
       go run main.go "Hi!" shadow

       go run . --output=output.txt something standard

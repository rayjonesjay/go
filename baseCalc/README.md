## BASE CONVERTER
****************

## Objectives
My program converts a number in base X to base N:
The program runs using a technique called `REPL` Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.

## Example
To convert from base 2 to 10. 
Set mode to 2->10, the arrow  direction is also crucial as you can also do 10<-2 to mean the same.
```
[in] : mode=2->10
[in]: 0010
[out]: 2
```
## Usage
You can run the program using the command below.
`$ go run .`

You can also build the program and run the generated binary as below:
step 1: build
`$ go build -o converter .`

step 2: run
`$ ./converter`

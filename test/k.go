/*
a graph algorithm is a set of instructions or a procedure designed to solve a problem or perform
a task on a graph data structure.

In applications where data is represented as a graph, graph algorithms have proven to be useful in operations
such as finding patterns and relationships in data, optimizing transportation or shipping networks, to drug
repurposing, to detect complex cases of fraud.

GRAPH DATA STRUCTURE 101

A graph consist of 2 things:
- node / vertices
- edge

edge links the node(s) together.
Example:
A-B

A an B are nodes and the hiphen is the edge linking them

Graph data is stored in a graph database like Neo4j or Memgraph which can be queried using a graph query language.
